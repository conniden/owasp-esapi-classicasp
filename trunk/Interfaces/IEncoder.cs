        /// has been reduced to its most basic form before validation. For example,
        /// URL-encoded data received from ordinary "application/x-www-url-encoded"
        /// forms so that it may be validated properly.
        ///
        /// Canonicalization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded
        /// string down to its simplest form. This is important, because attackers
        /// frequently use encoding to change their input in a way that will bypass
        /// validation filters, but still be interpreted properly by the target of
        /// the attack. Note that data encoded more than once is not something that a
        /// normal user would generate and should be regarded as an attack.
        /// 
        /// For input that comes from an HTTP servlet request, there are generally
        /// two types of encoding to be concerned with. The first is
        /// "applicaton/x-www-url-encoded" which is what is typically used in most
        /// forms and URI's where characters are encoded in a %xy format. The other
        /// type of common character encoding is HTML entity encoding, which uses
        /// several formats:
        /// 
        /// &lt;
        /// &#117;, and
        /// &#x3a;
        /// 
        /// Note that all of these formats may possibly render properly in a
        /// browser without the trailing semi-colon.
        /// 
        /// Double-encoding is a particularly thorny problem, as applying ordinary decoders
        /// may introduce encoded characters, even characters encoded with a different
        /// encoding scheme. For example %26lt; is a &lt; character which has been entity encoded
        /// and then the first character has been url-encoded. Implementations should
        /// throw an IntrusionException when double-encoded characters are detected.
        /// 
        /// Note that there is also "multipart/form" encoding, which allows files and
        /// other binary data to be transmitted. Each part of a multipart form can
        /// itself be encoded according to a "Content-Transfer-Encoding" header. See
        /// the HttpUtilties.GetSafeFileUploads() method.
